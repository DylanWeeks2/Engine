# **<ins>Overview</ins>**  
This project is the C++ game engine that is used to make all my personal projects and games. This game engine contains a DirectX 11 rendering pipeline, a 2D/3D math and physics library, and systems for important gameplay functionality such as audio, input, events, etc.


**Tools:** C++, HLSL, DirectX 11  
**Development Timeline:** August 2022 â€“ Present


# **<ins>Project Features</ins>**  
### **Game Engine Systems**  
This game engine contains the following systems:  
- Audio system (FMOD)
- Input system (mouse, keyboard, Xbox controller)
- Event system
- Debug rendering system
- Development console
- TCP networking system
- Multithreaded job system
- Parsers for XML, OBJ, 3DSprite, TXT, and binary files


### **2D/3D Math and Physics Library**  
The math and physics library supports the following features:  
- Collisions and raycasts for AABBs, OBBs, capsules, discs, spheres, and lines
- General math utilities for dot product, cross product, projected lengths, easing functions, splines, interpolation, etc.
- Physics simulations for Position Based Dynamics and a Mass-Spring System


### **DirectX 11 Rendering Pipeline**  
This engine contains a DirectX 11 rendering pipeline to support texturing, HLSL shader support, sprite animations, sprite sheets, bitmap fonts, and render target/depth stencil effects.
